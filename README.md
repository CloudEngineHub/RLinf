<h1 align="center">RLinf: Reinforcement Learning Infrastructure For Agentic AI</h1>

RLinf is a flexible and scalable infrastructure designed for post-training foundation models via reinforcement learning. The 'inf' in RLinf stands for Infrastructure, highlighting its role as a robust backbone for next-generation training. It also stands for Infinite, symbolizing the systemâ€™s support for open-ended learning, continuous generalization, and limitless possibilities in intelligence development.

Centered on Agentic Reinforcement Learning , RLinf aims to support the training and evaluation of next-generation agents. Version 0.1 focuses on embodied agents (VLM&VLA), with future releases expanding to support tool-using agents and beyond.
